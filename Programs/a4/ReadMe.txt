SUMMARY: 

This program is a test suites on its functionbility of many vector 
calculations, and message are printed out



Files:

README.txt  --  This file

*** .cpp files

testMain.cpp -- source code (main)
		test functions on whether the program works for 
		different functions 

vect.cpp -- defines all functions used for Vect class
		including constructor, DTOR of vect
	        getting magnitude of vector,
            	setting elements of vector,
             	Vector arithmetic (Addition, Subtraction, 
		Scalar Multiplication, Dot Product,Cross Product
             

*** .h files

vect.h -- defines the class Vect, declaration of all private and public 
	     functions assigned to it
testMain.h --declaration of all private and public 
	     functions assigned to testMain.cpp






All code tested and working fine.
